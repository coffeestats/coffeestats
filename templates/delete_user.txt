Hello Team,

coffeestats.org account @user@ (ID @id@) wants to be deleted.

The following SQL Queries could be useful. Always be careful!

DELETE FROM cs_users WHERE uid = @id@ ;
DELETE FROM cs_caffeine WHERE cuid = @id@ ; 
DELETE FROM cs_actions WHERE cuid = @id@ ; 

Best regards,
your coffeestats.org team
